# 24-7-jar

The idea to build this app was coming from 365 Jar that is usually listed as a perfect idea for anniversary gift. Hence, it holds a sort of romantic value.
It also can be used to randomly choose a movie or TV show as some of us often get overwhelmed by too many choices from the online streaming site.
The perk of this digital notes is, unlike the handwritten notes that allows you to open only one note a day, it allows you to open as many "notes" as you want.

This web app is a single page application built by using mainly React.js, and some styles using CSS also basic HTML. 
The 5 "notes" functions was built by using React.js and 3 API servers was used to call 5 HTTP request to each of the functions. <br />
Magenta and Orange: Quotable Random Quotes API by lukePeavey <br />
Yellow: NASA's APOD API <br />
Pink and Red: The Movie Database API <br />

During the building of this app, I encountered some error specifically in HTTP request part as API evolved rapidly and some 
API servers are changing their terms and so on. There are a few API servers that somehow do not allow me to access the data. And all appreciations
goes to Jack Jeffress for helping me solve the API servers issues. 

Nevertheless, coding needs consistent and constant exercises. 
After grasp all the concept, we need to code over and over again. Like doing mathematics.

For this 24/7 Jar, I want to add a function to randomly generate a song title. 
I might want to create another jar for kdrama, kmovie and kpop lovers if I find API servers that I can use specifically for that purpose.
