idea overview
- 24/7 Jar was coming from 365 Jar that is usually listed as a perfect idea for anniversary gift. Hence it holds a sort of romantic value. It is not cringe as it also can be used to randomly choose movies and TV shows. We often get overwhelmed with too many choices from the online streaming site, so this one can solve that problem. The perk of this digital notes jar is, unlike the handwritten notes that needs you to open one note a day, this jar allows you to open as many "notes" as you want. 

-walkthrough the code
The code used to make this app is mainly React.js, with some styles using CSS and basic HTML. I started with the index, and I first list down all the functions I want, then I build the function by calling the http request and then slowly add the functions one by one to the main react app file which is app.js. Lastly, I styled the page using CSS. 

-technical hurdle
APIs changed rapidly and there are some conditions that somehow does not allow me to access the data. 
"Its not your code" -Jack. So I believe I'm doing good. And all credits and appreciations goes to Jack for helping me with the APIs issues. 

- Things I learned
Nevertheless, coding, html css js or even react.js need constant exercise, consistently. Grasp the concept first, and do it over and over again. Like Mathematics. I think its fun because I love mathematics and I somehow developed interest in this field since I was 14. 

- What next?
I wanna add song choice to the notes because why not? But I couldnt yet solve the issue since some api has straightforward query. I need to look up on that. Also, since I love watching kdrama, I am interested to do one for kdrama, kmovie and kpop lovers.
